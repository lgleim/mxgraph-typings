    /**
        * Implements a generic shape which is based on a XML node as a description.
        *
        * shape:
        *
        * The outer element is *shape*, that has attributes:
        *
        * - "name", string, required. The stencil name that uniquely identifies the shape.
        * - "w" and "h" are optional decimal view bounds. This defines your co-ordinate
        * system for the graphics operations in the shape. The default is 100,100.
        * - "aspect", optional string. Either "variable", the default, or "fixed". Fixed
        * means always render the shape with the aspect ratio defined by the ratio w/h.
        * Variable causes the ratio to match that of the geometry of the current vertex.
        * - "strokewidth", optional string. Either an integer or the string "inherit".
        * "inherit" indicates that the strokeWidth of the cell is only changed on scaling,
        * not on resizing. Default is "1".
        * If numeric values are used, the strokeWidth of the cell is changed on both
        * scaling and resizing and the value defines the multiple that is applied to
        * the width.
        *
        * connections:
        *
        * If you want to define specific fixed connection points on the shape use the
        * *connections* element. Each *constraint* element within connections defines
        * a fixed connection point on the shape. Constraints have attributes:
        *
        * - "perimeter", required. 1 or 0. 0 sets the connection point where specified
        * by x,y. 1 Causes the position of the connection point to be extrapolated from
        * the center of the shape, through x,y to the point of intersection with the
        * perimeter of the shape.
        * - "x" and "y" are the position of the fixed point relative to the bounds of
        * the shape. They can be automatically adjusted if perimeter=1. So, (0,0) is top
        * left, (0.5,0.5) the center, (1,0.5) the center of the right hand edge of the
        * bounds, etc. Values may be less than 0 or greater than 1 to be positioned
        * outside of the shape.
        * - "name", optional string. A unique identifier for the port on the shape.
        *
        * background and foreground:
        *
        * The path of the graphics drawing is split into two elements, *foreground* and
        * *background*. The split is to define which part any shadow applied to the shape
        * is derived from (the background). This, generally, means the background is the
        * line tracing of the outside of the shape, but not always.
        *
        * Any stroke, fill or fillstroke of a background must be the first element of the
        * foreground element, they must not be used within *background*. If the background
        * is empty, this is not required.
        *
        * Because the background cannot have any fill or stroke, it can contain only one
        * *path*, *rect*, *roundrect* or *ellipse* element (or none). It can also not
        * include *image*, *text* or *include-shape*.
        *
        * Note that the state, styling and drawing in mxGraph stencils is very close in
        * design to that of HTML 5 canvas. Tutorials on this subject, if you're not
        * familiar with the topic, will give a good high-level introduction to the
        * concepts used.
        *
        * State:
        *
        * Rendering within the foreground and background elements has the concept of
        * state. There are two types of operations other than state save/load, styling
        * and drawing. The styling operations change the current state, so you can save
        * the current state with <save/> and pull the last saved state from the state
        * stack using <restore/>.
        *
        * Styling:
        *
        * The elements that change colors within the current state all take a hash
        * prefixed hex color code ("#FFEA80").
        *
        * - *strokecolor*, this sets the color that drawing paths will be rendered in
        * when a stroke or fillstroke command is issued.
        * - *fillcolor*, this sets the color that the inside of closed paths will be
        * rendered in when a fill or fillstroke command is issued.
        * - *fontcolor*, this sets the color that fonts are rendered in when text is drawn.
        *
        * *alpha* defines the degree of transparency used between 1.0 for fully opaque
        * and 0.0 for fully transparent.
        *
        * *strokewidth* defines the integer thickness of drawing elements rendered by
        * stroking. Use fixed="1" to apply the value as-is, without scaling.
        *
        * *dashed* is "1" for dashing enabled and "0" for disabled.
        *
        * When *dashed* is enabled the current dash pattern, defined by *dashpattern*,
        * is used on strokes. dashpattern is a sequence of space separated "on, off"
        * lengths that define what distance to paint the stroke for, then what distance
        * to paint nothing for, repeat... The default is "3 3". You could define a more
        * complex pattern with "5 3 2 6", for example. Generally, it makes sense to have
        * an even number of elements in the dashpattern, but that's not required.
        *
        * *linejoin*, *linecap* and *miterlimit* are best explained by the Mozilla page
        * on Canvas styling (about halfway down). The values are all the same except we
        * use "flat" for linecap, instead of Canvas' "butt".
        *
        * For font styling there are.
        *
        * - *fontsize*, an integer,
        * - *fontstyle*, an ORed bit pattern of bold (1), italic (2) and underline (4),
        * i.e bold underline is "5".
        * - *fontfamily*, is a string defining the typeface to be used.
        *
        * Drawing:
        *
        * Most drawing is contained within a *path* element. Again, the graphic
        * primitives are very similar to that of HTML 5 canvas.
        *
        * - *move* to attributes required decimals (x,y).
        * - *line* to attributes required decimals (x,y).
        * - *quad* to required decimals (x2,y2) via control point required decimals
        * (x1,y1).
        * - *curve* to required decimals (x3,y3), via control points required decimals
        * (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
        * - *arc*, this doesn't follow the HTML Canvas signatures, instead it's a copy
        * of the SVG arc command. The SVG specification documentation gives the best
        * description of its behaviors. The attributes are named identically, they are
        * decimals and all required.
        * - *close* ends the current subpath and causes an automatic straight line to
        * be drawn from the current point to the initial point of the current subpath.
        *
        * Complex drawing:
        *
        * In addition to the graphics primitive operations there are non-primitive
        * operations. These provide an easy method to draw some basic shapes.
        *
        * - *rect*, attributes "x", "y", "w", "h", all required decimals
        * - *roundrect*, attributes "x", "y", "w", "h", all required decimals. Also
        * "arcsize" an optional decimal attribute defining how large, the corner curves
        * are.
        * - *ellipse*, attributes "x", "y", "w", "h", all required decimals.
        *
        * Note that these 3 shapes and all paths must be followed by either a fill,
        * stroke, or fillstroke.
        *
        * Text:
        *
        * *text* elements have the following attributes.
        *
        * - "str", the text string to display, required.
        * - "x" and "y", the decimal location (x,y) of the text element, required.
        * - "align", the horizontal alignment of the text element, either "left",
        * "center" or "right". Optional, default is "left".
        * - "valign", the vertical alignment of the text element, either "top", "middle"
        * or "bottom". Optional, default is "top".
        * - "localized", 0 or 1, if 1 then the "str" actually contains a key to use to
        * fetch the value out of mxResources. Optional, default is
        * <mxStencil.defaultLocalized>.
        * - "vertical", 0 or 1, if 1 the label is rendered vertically (rotated by 90
        * degrees). Optional, default is 0.
        * - "rotation", angle in degrees (0 to 360). The angle to rotate the text by.
        * Optional, default is 0.
        * - "align-shape", 0 or 1, if 0 ignore the rotation of the shape when setting
        * the text rotation. Optional, default is 1.
        *
        * If <allowEval> is true, then the text content of the this element can define
        * a function which is invoked with the shape as the only argument and returns
        * the value for the text element (ignored if the str attribute is not null).
        *
        * Images:
        *
        * *image* elements can either be external URLs, or data URIs, where supported
        * (not in IE 7-). Attributes are:
        *
        * - "src", required string. Either a data URI or URL.
        * - "x", "y", required decimals. The (x,y) position of the image.
        * - "w", "h", required decimals. The width and height of the image.
        * - "flipH" and "flipV", optional 0 or 1. Whether to flip the image along the
        * horizontal/vertical axis. Default is 0 for both.
        *
        * If <allowEval> is true, then the text content of the this element can define
        * a function which is invoked with the shape as the only argument and returns
        * the value for the image source (ignored if the src attribute is not null).
        *
        * Sub-shapes:
        *
        * *include-shape* allow stencils to be rendered within the current stencil by
        * referencing the sub-stencil by name. Attributes are:
        *
        * - "name", required string. The unique shape name of the stencil.
        * - "x", "y", "w", "h", required decimals. The (x,y) position of the sub-shape
        * and its width and height.

    /**
        * Base class for all shapes. A shape in mxGraph is a
        * separate implementation for SVG, VML and HTML. Which
        * implementation to use is controlled by the <dialect>
        * property which is assigned from within the <mxCellRenderer>
        * when the shape is created. The dialect must be assigned
        * for a shape, and it does normally depend on the browser and
        * the confiuration of the graph (see <mxGraph> rendering hint).
        *
        * For each supported shape in SVG and VML, a corresponding
        * shape exists in mxGraph, namely for text, image, rectangle,
        * rhombus, ellipse and polyline. The other shapes are a
        * combination of these shapes (eg. label and swimlane)
        * or they consist of one or more (filled) path objects
        * (eg. actor and cylinder). The HTML implementation is
        * optional but may be required for a HTML-only view of
        * the graph.
        *
        * Custom Shapes:
        *
        * To extend from this class, the basic code looks as follows.
        * In the special case where the custom shape consists only of
        * one filled region or one filled region and an additional stroke
        * the <mxActor> and <mxCylinder> should be subclassed,
        * respectively.
        *
        * (code)
        * function CustomShape() { }
        *
        * CustomShape.prototype = new mxShape();
        * CustomShape.prototype.constructor = CustomShape;
        * (end)
        *
        * To register a custom shape in an existing graph instance,
        * one must register the shape under a new name in the graph's
        * cell renderer as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * mxCellRenderer.registerShape('customShape', CustomShape);
        * (end)
        *
        * The second argument is the name of the constructor.
        *
        * In order to use the shape you can refer to the given name above
        * in a stylesheet. For example, to change the shape for the default
        * vertex style, the following code is used:
        *
        * (code)
        * var style = graph.getStylesheet().getDefaultVertexStyle();
        * style[mxConstants.STYLE_SHAPE] = 'customShape';

        * XML HTTP request wrapper. See also: <mxUtils.get>, <mxUtils.post> and
        * <mxUtils.load>. This class provides a cross-browser abstraction for Ajax
        * requests.
        *
        * Encoding:
        *
        * For encoding parameter values, the built-in encodeURIComponent JavaScript
        * method must be used. For automatic encoding of post data in <mxEditor> the
        * <mxEditor.escapePostData> switch can be set to true (default). The encoding
        * will be carried out using the conte type of the page. That is, the page
        * containting the editor should contain a meta tag in the header, eg.
        * <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * (code)
        * var onload = function(req)
        * {
        *   mxUtils.alert(req.getDocumentElement());

        * }
        * new mxXmlRequest(url, 'key=value').send(onload, onerror);
        * (end)
        *
        * Sends an asynchronous POST request to the specified URL.
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * (code)
        * var req = new mxXmlRequest(url, 'key=value', 'POST', false);
        * req.send();
        * mxUtils.alert(req.getDocumentElement());
        * (end)
        *
        * Sends a synchronous POST request to the specified URL.
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * (code)
        * var encoder = new mxCodec();
        * var result = encoder.encode(graph.getModel());
        * var xml = encodeURIComponent(mxUtils.getXml(result));
        * new mxXmlRequest(url, 'xml='+xml).send();
        * (end)
        *
        * Sends an encoded graph model to the specified URL using xml as the
        * parameter name. The parameter can then be retrieved in C# as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * string xml = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(context.Request.Params["xml"]);
        * (end)
        *
        * Or in Java as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * String xml = URLDecoder.decode(request.getParameter("xml"), "UTF-8").replace("\n", "&#xa;");
        * (end)
        *
        * Note that the linefeeds should only be replaced if the XML is
        * processed in Java, for example when creating an image.
        *
        * Constructor: mxXmlRequest
        *

        * to the given stylename as follows:
        *
        *   style - Base style for the window.
        *   style+Title - Style for the window title.
        *   style+Pane - Style for the window pane.

        * The default value for style is mxWindow, resulting in the following
        * classnames for the window elements: mxWindow, mxWindowTitle and
        * mxWindowPane.
        *
        * If replaceNode is given then the window replaces the given DOM node in
        * the document.

        *
        * title - String that represents the title of the new window.
        * content - DOM node that is used as the window content.
        * x - X-coordinate of the window location.
        * y - Y-coordinate of the window location.
        * width - Width of the window.
        * height - Optional height of the window. Default is to match the height
        * of the content at the specified width.
        * minimizable - Optional boolean indicating if the window is minimizable.
        * Default is true.
        * movable - Optional boolean indicating if the window is movable. Default
        * is true.
        * replaceNode - Optional DOM node that the window should replace.
        * style - Optional base classname for the window elements. Default is
        * mxWindow.

        * <mxUndoManager>. This is done by an event listener in
        * <mxEditor.installUndoHandler>.
        *
        * Each atomic change of the model is represented by an object (eg.
        * <mxRootChange>, <mxChildChange>, <mxTerminalChange> etc) which contains the
        * complete undo information. The <mxUndoManager> also listens to the

        * undoable changes, so that drilling (step into, step up) is undone.
        *
        * This means when you execute an atomic change on the model, then change the
        * current root on the view and click undo, the change of the root will be
        * undone together with the change of the model so that the display represents
        * the state at which the model was changed. However, these changes are not
        * transmitted for sharing as they do not represent a state change.
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * When adding an undo manager to a graph, make sure to add it
        * to the model and the view as well to maintain a consistent
        * display across multiple undo/redo steps.
        *
        * (code)
        * var undoManager = new mxUndoManager();

        * graph.getView().addListener(mxEvent.UNDO, listener);

    /**
        * Extends <mxEventSource> to implement a graph model. The graph model acts as
        * a wrapper around the cells which are in charge of storing the actual graph
        * datastructure. The model acts as a transactional wrapper with event
        * notification for all changes, whereas the cells contain the atomic
        * operations for updating the actual datastructure.
        *
        * Layers:
        *
        * The cell hierarchy in the model must have a top-level root cell which
        * contains the layers (typically one default layer), which in turn contain the
        * top-level cells of the layers. This means each cell is contained in a layer.
        * If no layers are required, then all new cells should be added to the default
        * layer.
        *
        * Layers are useful for hiding and showing groups of cells, or for placing
        * groups of cells on top of other cells in the display. To identify a layer,
        * the <isLayer> function is used. It returns true if the parent of the given
        * cell is the root of the model.
        *
        * Events:
        *
        * See events section for more details. There is a new set of events for
        * tracking transactional changes as they happen. The events are called
        * startEdit for the initial beginUpdate, executed for each executed change
        * and endEdit for the terminal endUpdate. The executed event contains a
        * property called change which represents the change after execution.
        *
        * Encoding the model:
        *
        * To encode a graph model, use the following code:
        *
        * (code)
        * var enc = new mxCodec();
        * var node = enc.encode(graph.getModel());
        * (end)
        *
        * This will create an XML node that contains all the model information.
        *
        * Encoding and decoding changes:
        *
        * For the encoding of changes, a graph model listener is required that encodes
        * each change from the given array of changes.
        *
        * (code)
        * model.addListener(mxEvent.CHANGE, function(sender, evt)
        * {
        *   var changes = evt.getProperty('edit').changes;
        *   var nodes = [];
        *   var codec = new mxCodec();
        *
        *   for (var i = 0; i < changes.length; i++)
        *   {
        *     nodes.push(codec.encode(changes[i]));
        *   }
        *   // do something with the nodes
        * });
        * (end)
        *
        * For the decoding and execution of changes, the codec needs a lookup function
        * that allows it to resolve cell IDs as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * var codec = new mxCodec();
        * codec.lookup = function(id)
        * {
        *   return model.getCell(id);
        * }
        * (end)
        *
        * For each encoded change (represented by a node), the following code can be
        * used to carry out the decoding and create a change object.
        *
        * (code)
        * var changes = [];
        * var change = codec.decode(node);
        * change.model = model;
        * change.execute();
        * changes.push(change);
        * (end)
        *
        * The changes can then be dispatched using the model as follows.
        *
        * (code)
        * var edit = new mxUndoableEdit(model, false);
        * edit.changes = changes;
        *
        * edit.notify = function()
        * {
        *   edit.source.fireEvent(new mxEventObject(mxEvent.CHANGE,
        *   	'edit', edit, 'changes', edit.changes));
        *   edit.source.fireEvent(new mxEventObject(mxEvent.NOTIFY,
        *   	'edit', edit, 'changes', edit.changes));
        * }
        *
        * model.fireEvent(new mxEventObject(mxEvent.UNDO, 'edit', edit));
        * model.fireEvent(new mxEventObject(mxEvent.CHANGE,
        * 		'edit', edit, 'changes', changes));

        * is <strong>deprecated</strong>, please use edit.changes instead.
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * For finding newly inserted cells, the following code can be used:
        *
        * (code)
        * graph.model.addListener(mxEvent.CHANGE, function(sender, evt)
        * {
        *   var changes = evt.getProperty('edit').changes;
        *
        *   for (var i = 0; i < changes.length; i++)
        *   {
        *     var change = changes[i];
        *
        *     if (change instanceof mxChildChange &&
        *       change.change.previous == null)
        *     {
        *       graph.startEditingAtCell(change.child);
        *       break;
        *     }
        *   }
        * });
        * (end)

        *
        * Event: mxEvent.NOTIFY

        * implement a sync mechanism between this model and, say, a remote model. In

        * For vertices, the geometry consists of the x- and y-location, and the width
        * and height. For edges, the geometry consists of the optional terminal- and
        * control points. The terminal points are only required if an edge is
        * unconnected, and are stored in the sourcePoint> and <targetPoint>
        * variables, respectively.
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * If an edge is unconnected, that is, it has no source or target terminal,
        * then a geometry with terminal points for a new edge can be defined as
        * follows.
        *
        * (code)
        * geometry.setTerminalPoint(new mxPoint(x1, y1), true);
        * geometry.points = [new mxPoint(x2, y2)];
        * geometry.setTerminalPoint(new mxPoint(x3, y3), false);
        * (end)
        *
        * Control points are used regardless of the connected state of an edge and may
        * be ignored or interpreted differently depending on the edge's <mxEdgeStyle>.
        *
        * To disable automatic reset of control points after a cell has been moved or
        * resized, the the <mxGraph.resizeEdgesOnMove> and
        * <mxGraph.resetEdgesOnResize> may be used.
        *
        * Edge Labels:
        *
        * Using the x- and y-coordinates of a cell's geometry, it is possible to
        * position the label on edges on a specific location on the actual edge shape
        * as it appears on the screen. The x-coordinate of an edge's geometry is used
        * to describe the distance from the center of the edge from -1 to 1 with 0
        * being the center of the edge and the default value. The y-coordinate of an
        * edge's geometry is used to describe the absolute, orthogonal distance in
        * pixels from that point. In addition, the <mxGeometry.offset> is used as an
        * absolute offset vector from the resulting point.
        *
        * This coordinate system is applied if <relative> is true, otherwise the
        * offset defines the absolute vector from the edge's center point to the
        * label and the values for <x> and <y> are ignored.
        *
        * The width and height parameter for edge geometries can be used to set the
        * label width and height (eg. for word wrapping).
        *
        * Ports:
        *
        * The term "port" refers to a relatively positioned, connectable child cell,
        * which is used to specify the connection between the parent and another cell
        * in the graph. Ports are typically modeled as vertices with relative
        * geometries.
        *
        * Offsets:
        *
        * The <offset> field is interpreted in 3 different ways, depending on the cell
        * and the geometry. For edges, the offset defines the absolute offset for the
        * edge label. For relative geometries, the offset defines the absolute offset
        * for the origin (top, left corner) of the vertex, otherwise the offset
        * defines the absolute offset for the label inside the vertex or group.

        * preview.open();
        * (end)
        *
        * Use <mxUtils.getScaleForPageCount> as follows in order to print the graph
        * across a given number of pages:
        *
        * (code)
        * var pageCount = mxUtils.prompt('Enter page count', '1');
        *
        * if (pageCount != null)

        *   preview.open();
        * }
        * (end)
        *
        * Additional pages:
        *
        * To add additional pages before and after the output, <getCoverPages> and
        * <getAppendices> can be used, respectively.
        *
        * (code)
        * var preview = new mxPrintPreview(graph, 1);
        *
        * preview.getCoverPages = function(w, h)
        * {
        *   return [this.renderPage(w, h, 0, 0, mxUtils.bind(this, function(div)
        *   {

        *   }))];
        * };
        *
        * preview.open();
        * (end)
        *
        * CSS:
        *
        * The CSS from the original page is not carried over to the print preview.
        * To add CSS to the page, use the css argument in the <open> function or
        * override <writeHead> to add the respective link tags as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * var writeHead = preview.writeHead;
        * preview.writeHead = function(doc, css)
        * {
        *   writeHead.apply(this, arguments);
        *   doc.writeln('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">');
        * };
        * (end)
        *
        * Padding:
        *
        * To add a padding to the page in the preview (but not the print output), use
        * the following code:
        *
        * (code)
        * preview.writeHead = function(doc)
        * {
        *   writeHead.apply(this, arguments);
        *
        *   doc.writeln('<style type="text/css">');
        *   doc.writeln('@media screen {');
        *   doc.writeln('  body > div { padding-top:30px;padding-left:40px;box-sizing:content-box; }');
        *   doc.writeln('}');
        *   doc.writeln('</style>');
        * };
        * (end)
        *
        * Headers:
        *
        * Apart from setting the title argument in the mxPrintPreview constructor you
        * can override <renderPage> as follows to add a header to any page:
        *
        * (code)
        * var oldRenderPage = mxPrintPreview.prototype.renderPage;
        * mxPrintPreview.prototype.renderPage = function(w, h, x, y, content, pageNumber)
        * {
        *   var div = oldRenderPage.apply(this, arguments);
        *
        *   var header = document.createElement('div');
        *   header.style.position = 'absolute';
        *   header.style.top = '0px';
        *   header.style.width = '100%';
        *   header.style.textAlign = 'right';
        *   mxUtils.write(header, 'Your header here');
        *   div.firstChild.appendChild(header);
        *
        *   return div;
        * };
        * (end)
        *
        * The pageNumber argument contains the number of the current page, starting at
        * 1. To display a header on the first page only, check pageNumber and add a
        * vertical offset in the constructor call for the height of the header.
        *
        * Page Format:
        *
        * For landscape printing, use <mxConstants.PAGE_FORMAT_A4_LANDSCAPE> as
        * the pageFormat in <mxUtils.getScaleForPageCount> and <mxPrintPreview>.
        * Keep in mind that one can not set the defaults for the print dialog
        * of the operating system from JavaScript so the user must manually choose
        * a page format that matches this setting.
        *
        * You can try passing the following CSS directive to <open> to set the
        * page format in the print dialog to landscape. However, this CSS
        * directive seems to be ignored in most major browsers, including IE.
        *
        * (code)
        * @page {
        *   size: landscape;
        * }
        * (end)
        *
        * Note that the print preview behaves differently in IE when used from the
        * filesystem or via HTTP so printing should always be tested via HTTP.
        *
        * If you are using a DOCTYPE in the source page you can override <getDoctype>
        * and provide the same DOCTYPE for the print preview if required. Here is
        * an example for IE8 standards mode.
        *
        * (code)
        * var preview = new mxPrintPreview(graph);
        * preview.getDoctype = function()
        * {
        *   return '<!--[if IE]><meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=5,IE=8" ><![endif]-->';
        * };
        * preview.open();
        * (end)

        * scale - Optional scale of the output. Default is 1 / <mxGraph.pageScale>.
        * border - Border in pixels along each side of every page. Note that the
        * actual print function in the browser will add another border for
        * printing.
        * pageFormat - <mxRectangle> that specifies the page format (in pixels).
        * This should match the page format of the printer. Default uses the
        * <mxGraph.pageFormat> of the given graph.
        * x0 - Optional left offset of the output. Default is 0.
        * y0 - Optional top offset of the output. Default is 0.
        * borderColor - Optional color of the page border. Default is no border.
        * Note that a border is sometimes useful to highlight the printed page
        * border in the print preview of the browser.
        * title - Optional string that is used for the window title. Default
        * is 'Printer-friendly version'.
        * pageSelector - Optional boolean that specifies if the page selector
        * should appear in the window with the print preview. Default is true.

        *
        * Modifies the built-in default styles.
        *
        * To avoid the default style for a cell, add a leading semicolon
        * to the style definition, eg.
        *
        * (code)
        * ;shadow=1

        * Cell Images:

        * <mxConstants.SHAPE_IMAGE> and <mxConstants.SHAPE_LABEL>.
        * The code to change the shape used in the default vertex style,

        * (code)

        * style[mxConstants.STYLE_SHAPE] = mxConstants.SHAPE_IMAGE;
        * (end)
        *
        * For the default vertex style, the image to be displayed can be
        * specified in a cell's style using the <mxConstants.STYLE_IMAGE>
        * key and the image URL as a value, for example:
        *
        * (code)
        * image=http://www.example.com/image.gif
        * (end)
        *
        * For a named style, the the stylename must be the first element
        * of the cell style:
        *
        * (code)
        * stylename;image=http://www.example.com/image.gif
        * (end)
        *
        * A cell style can have any number of key=value pairs added, divided
        * by a semicolon as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * [stylename;|key=value;]
        * (end)
        *
        * Labels:
        *
        * The cell labels are defined by <getLabel> which uses <convertValueToString>
        * if <labelsVisible> is true. If a label must be rendered as HTML markup, then
        * <isHtmlLabel> should return true for the respective cell. If all labels
        * contain HTML markup, <htmlLabels> can be set to true. NOTE: Enabling HTML
        * labels carries a possible security risk (see the section on security in
        * the manual).
        *
        * If wrapping is needed for a label, then <isHtmlLabel> and <isWrapping> must
        * return true for the cell whose label should be wrapped. See <isWrapping> for
        * an example.
        *
        * If clipping is needed to keep the rendering of a HTML label inside the
        * bounds of its vertex, then <isClipping> should return true for the
        * respective cell.
        *
        * By default, edge labels are movable and vertex labels are fixed. This can be
        * changed by setting <edgeLabelsMovable> and <vertexLabelsMovable>, or by
        * overriding <isLabelMovable>.
        *
        * In-place Editing:
        *
        * In-place editing is started with a doubleclick or by typing F2.
        * Programmatically, <edit> is used to check if the cell is editable
        * (<isCellEditable>) and call <startEditingAtCell>, which invokes
        * <mxCellEditor.startEditing>. The editor uses the value returned
        * by <getEditingValue> as the editing value.
        *
        * After in-place editing, <labelChanged> is called, which invokes
        * <mxGraphModel.setValue>, which in turn calls
        * <mxGraphModel.valueForCellChanged> via <mxValueChange>.
        *
        * The event that triggers in-place editing is passed through to the
        * <cellEditor>, which may take special actions depending on the type of the
        * event or mouse location, and is also passed to <getEditingValue>. The event
        * is then passed back to the event processing functions which can perform
        * specific actions based on the trigger event.
        *
        * Tooltips:
        *
        * Tooltips are implemented by <getTooltip>, which calls <getTooltipForCell>
        * if a cell is under the mousepointer. The default implementation checks if
        * the cell has a getTooltip function and calls it if it exists. Hence, in order
        * to provide custom tooltips, the cell must provide a getTooltip function, or
        * one of the two above functions must be overridden.
        *
        * Typically, for custom cell tooltips, the latter function is overridden as
        * follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * graph.getTooltipForCell = function(cell)
        * {
        *   var label = this.convertValueToString(cell);
        *   return 'Tooltip for '+label;
        * }
        * (end)
        *
        * When using a config file, the function is overridden in the mxGraph section
        * using the following entry:
        *
        * (code)
        * <add as="getTooltipForCell"><![CDATA[
        *   function(cell)
        *   {
        *     var label = this.convertValueToString(cell);
        *     return 'Tooltip for '+label;
        *   }
        * ]]></add>
        * (end)
        *
        * "this" refers to the graph in the implementation, so for example to check if
        * a cell is an edge, you use this.getModel().isEdge(cell)
        *
        * For replacing the default implementation of <getTooltipForCell> (rather than
        * replacing the function on a specific instance), the following code should be
        * used after loading the JavaScript files, but before creating a new mxGraph
        * instance using <mxGraph>:
        *
        * (code)
        * mxGraph.prototype.getTooltipForCell = function(cell)
        * {
        *   var label = this.convertValueToString(cell);
        *   return 'Tooltip for '+label;
        * }
        * (end)
        *
        * Shapes & Styles:
        *
        * The implementation of new shapes is demonstrated in the examples. We'll assume
        * that we have implemented a custom shape with the name BoxShape which we want
        * to use for drawing vertices. To use this shape, it must first be registered in
        * the cell renderer as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * mxCellRenderer.registerShape('box', BoxShape);
        * (end)
        *
        * The code registers the BoxShape constructor under the name box in the cell
        * renderer of the graph. The shape can now be referenced using the shape-key in
        * a style definition. (The cell renderer contains a set of additional shapes,
        * namely one for each constant with a SHAPE-prefix in <mxConstants>.)
        *
        * Styles are a collection of key, value pairs and a stylesheet is a collection
        * of named styles. The names are referenced by the cellstyle, which is stored
        * in <mxCell.style> with the following format: [stylename;|key=value;]. The
        * string is resolved to a collection of key, value pairs, where the keys are
        * overridden with the values in the string.
        *
        * When introducing a new shape, the name under which the shape is registered
        * must be used in the stylesheet. There are three ways of doing this:
        *
        *   - By changing the default style, so that all vertices will use the new
        * 		shape
        *   - By defining a new style, so that only vertices with the respective
        * 		cellstyle will use the new shape
        *   - By using shape=box in the cellstyle's optional list of key, value pairs
        * 		to be overridden
        *
        * In the first case, the code to fetch and modify the default style for
        * vertices is as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * var style = graph.getStylesheet().getDefaultVertexStyle();
        * style[mxConstants.STYLE_SHAPE] = 'box';
        * (end)
        *
        * The code takes the default vertex style, which is used for all vertices that
        * do not have a specific cellstyle, and modifies the value for the shape-key
        * in-place to use the new BoxShape for drawing vertices. This is done by
        * assigning the box value in the second line, which refers to the name of the
        * BoxShape in the cell renderer.
        *
        * In the second case, a collection of key, value pairs is created and then
        * added to the stylesheet under a new name. In order to distinguish the
        * shapename and the stylename we'll use boxstyle for the stylename:
        *
        * (code)
        * var style = new Object();
        * style[mxConstants.STYLE_SHAPE] = 'box';
        * style[mxConstants.STYLE_STROKECOLOR] = '#000000';
        * style[mxConstants.STYLE_FONTCOLOR] = '#000000';
        * graph.getStylesheet().putCellStyle('boxstyle', style);
        * (end)
        *
        * The code adds a new style with the name boxstyle to the stylesheet. To use
        * this style with a cell, it must be referenced from the cellstyle as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * var vertex = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Hello, World!', 20, 20, 80, 20,
        * 				'boxstyle');
        * (end)
        *
        * To summarize, each new shape must be registered in the <mxCellRenderer> with
        * a unique name. That name is then used as the value of the shape-key in a
        * default or custom style. If there are multiple custom shapes, then there
        * should be a separate style for each shape.
        *
        * Inheriting Styles:
        *
        * For fill-, stroke-, gradient- and indicatorColors special keywords can be
        * used. The inherit keyword for one of these colors will inherit the color
        * for the same key from the parent cell. The swimlane keyword does the same,
        * but inherits from the nearest swimlane in the ancestor hierarchy. Finally,
        * the indicated keyword will use the color of the indicator as the color for
        * the given key.
        *
        * Scrollbars:
        *
        * The <containers> overflow CSS property defines if scrollbars are used to
        * display the graph. For values of 'auto' or 'scroll', the scrollbars will
        * be shown. Note that the <resizeContainer> flag is normally not used
        * together with scrollbars, as it will resize the container to match the
        * size of the graph after each change.
        *
        * Multiplicities and Validation:
        *
        * To control the possible connections in mxGraph, <getEdgeValidationError> is
        * used. The default implementation of the function uses <multiplicities>,
        * which is an array of <mxMultiplicity>. Using this class allows to establish
        * simple multiplicities, which are enforced by the graph.
        *
        * The <mxMultiplicity> uses <mxCell.is> to determine for which terminals it
        * applies. The default implementation of <mxCell.is> works with DOM nodes (XML
        * nodes) and checks if the given type parameter matches the nodeName of the
        * node (case insensitive). Optionally, an attributename and value can be
        * specified which are also checked.
        *
        * <getEdgeValidationError> is called whenever the connectivity of an edge
        * changes. It returns an empty string or an error message if the edge is
        * invalid or null if the edge is valid. If the returned string is not empty
        * then it is displayed as an error message.
        *
        * <mxMultiplicity> allows to specify the multiplicity between a terminal and
        * its possible neighbors. For example, if any rectangle may only be connected
        * to, say, a maximum of two circles you can add the following rule to
        * <multiplicities>:
        *
        * (code)
        * graph.multiplicities.push(new mxMultiplicity(
        *   true, 'rectangle', null, null, 0, 2, ['circle'],
        *   'Only 2 targets allowed',
        *   'Only shape targets allowed'));
        * (end)
        *
        * This will display the first error message whenever a rectangle is connected
        * to more than two circles and the second error message if a rectangle is
        * connected to anything but a circle.
        *
        * For certain multiplicities, such as a minimum of 1 connection, which cannot
        * be enforced at cell creation time (unless the cell is created together with
        * the connection), mxGraph offers <validate> which checks all multiplicities
        * for all cells and displays the respective error messages in an overlay icon
        * on the cells.
        *
        * If a cell is collapsed and contains validation errors, a respective warning
        * icon is attached to the collapsed cell.
        *
        * Auto-Layout:
        *
        * For automatic layout, the <getLayout> hook is provided in <mxLayoutManager>.
        * It can be overridden to return a layout algorithm for the children of a
        * given cell.
        *
        * Unconnected edges:
        *
        * The default values for all switches are designed to meet the requirements of
        * general diagram drawing applications. A very typical set of settings to
        * avoid edges that are not connected is the following:
        *
        * (code)
        * graph.setAllowDanglingEdges(false);
        * graph.setDisconnectOnMove(false);
        * (end)
        *
        * Setting the <cloneInvalidEdges> switch to true is optional. This switch
        * controls if edges are inserted after a copy, paste or clone-drag if they are
        * invalid. For example, edges are invalid if copied or control-dragged without
        * having selected the corresponding terminals and allowDanglingEdges is
        * false, in which case the edges will not be cloned if the switch is false.
        *
        * Output:
        *
        * To produce an XML representation for a diagram, the following code can be
        * used.
        *
        * (code)
        * var enc = new mxCodec(mxUtils.createXmlDocument());
        * var node = enc.encode(graph.getModel());
        * (end)
        *
        * This will produce an XML node than can be handled using the DOM API or
        * turned into a string representation using the following code:
        *
        * (code)
        * var xml = mxUtils.getXml(node);
        * (end)
        *
        * To obtain a formatted string, mxUtils.getPrettyXml can be used instead.
        *
        * This string can now be stored in a local persistent storage (for example
        * using Google Gears) or it can be passed to a backend using mxUtils.post as
        * follows. The url variable is the URL of the Java servlet, PHP page or HTTP
        * handler, depending on the server.
        *
        * (code)
        * var xmlString = encodeURIComponent(mxUtils.getXml(node));
        * mxUtils.post(url, 'xml='+xmlString, function(req)
        * {
        *   // Process server response using req of type mxXmlRequest
        * });
        * (end)
        *
        * Input:
        *
        * To load an XML representation of a diagram into an existing graph object
        * mxUtils.load can be used as follows. The url variable is the URL of the Java
        * servlet, PHP page or HTTP handler that produces the XML string.
        *
        * (code)
        * var xmlDoc = mxUtils.load(url).getXml();
        * var node = xmlDoc.documentElement;
        * var dec = new mxCodec(node.ownerDocument);
        * dec.decode(node, graph.getModel());
        * (end)
        *
        * For creating a page that loads the client and a diagram using a single
        * request please refer to the deployment examples in the backends.

        * Constructor: mxGraph
        *
        * Constructs a new mxGraph in the specified container. Model is an optional
        * mxGraphModel. If no model is provided, a new mxGraphModel instance is
        * used as the model. The container must have a valid owner document prior
        * to calling this function in Internet Explorer. RenderHint is a string to
        * affect the display performance and rendering in IE, but not in SVG-based
        * browsers. The parameter is mapped to <dialect>, which may
        * be one of <mxConstants.DIALECT_SVG> for SVG-based browsers,
        * <mxConstants.DIALECT_STRICTHTML> for fastest display mode,
        * <mxConstants.DIALECT_PREFERHTML> for faster display mode,
        * <mxConstants.DIALECT_MIXEDHTML> for fast and <mxConstants.DIALECT_VML>
        * for exact display mode (slowest). The dialects are defined in mxConstants.
        * The default values are DIALECT_SVG for SVG-based browsers and
        * DIALECT_MIXED for IE.
        *
        * The possible values for the renderingHint parameter are explained below:
        *
        * fast - The parameter is based on the fact that the display performance is
        * highly improved in IE if the VML is not contained within a VML group
        * element. The lack of a group element only slightly affects the display while
        * panning, but improves the performance by almost a factor of 2, while keeping
        * the display sufficiently accurate. This also allows to render certain shapes as HTML
        * if the display accuracy is not affected, which is implemented by
        * <mxShape.isMixedModeHtml>. This is the default setting and is mapped to
        * DIALECT_MIXEDHTML.
        * faster - Same as fast, but more expensive shapes are avoided. This is
        * controlled by <mxShape.preferModeHtml>. The default implementation will
        * avoid gradients and rounded rectangles, but more significant shapes, such
        * as rhombus, ellipse, actor and cylinder will be rendered accurately. This
        * setting is mapped to DIALECT_PREFERHTML.
        * fastest - Almost anything will be rendered in Html. This allows for
        * rectangles, labels and images. This setting is mapped to
        * DIALECT_STRICTHTML.
        * exact - If accurate panning is required and if the diagram is small (up
        * to 100 cells), then this value should be used. In this mode, a group is
        * created that contains the VML. This allows for accurate panning and is
        * mapped to DIALECT_VML.
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * To create a graph inside a DOM node with an id of graph:
        * (code)
        * var container = document.getElementById('graph');
        * var graph = new mxGraph(container);
        * (end)
        *
        * container - Optional DOM node that acts as a container for the graph.
        * If this is null then the container can be initialized later using
        * <init>.
        * model - Optional <mxGraphModel> that constitutes the graph data.
        * renderHint - Optional string that specifies the display accuracy and
        * performance. Default is mxConstants.DIALECT_MIXEDHTML (for IE).
        * stylesheet - Optional <mxStylesheet> to be used in the graph.

        * Graph event handler that creates new connections. Uses <mxTerminalMarker>

        * <factoryMethod> to create the edge instance. This handler is built-into
        * <mxGraph.connectionHandler> and enabled using <mxGraph.setConnectable>.
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * (code)
        * new mxConnectionHandler(graph, function(source, target, style)
        * {
        *   edge = new mxCell('', new mxGeometry());
        *   edge.setEdge(true);
        *   edge.setStyle(style);
        *   edge.geometry.relative = true;
        *   return edge;
        * });
        * (end)
        *
        * Here is an alternative solution that just sets a specific user object for
        * new edges by overriding <insertEdge>.
        *
        * (code)
        * mxConnectionHandlerInsertEdge = mxConnectionHandler.prototype.insertEdge;
        * mxConnectionHandler.prototype.insertEdge = function(parent, id, value, source, target, style)
        * {
        *   value = 'Test';
        *
        *   return mxConnectionHandlerInsertEdge.apply(this, arguments);
        * };
        * (end)
        *
        * Using images to trigger connections:
        *
        * This handler uses mxTerminalMarker to find the source and target cell for
        * the new connection and creates a new edge using <connect>. The new edge is
        * created using <createEdge> which in turn uses <factoryMethod> or creates a
        * new default edge.
        *
        * The handler uses a "highlight-paradigm" for indicating if a cell is being
        * used as a source or target terminal, as seen in other diagramming products.
        * In order to allow both, moving and connecting cells at the same time,
        * <mxConstants.DEFAULT_HOTSPOT> is used in the handler to determine the hotspot
        * of a cell, that is, the region of the cell which is used to trigger a new
        * connection. The constant is a value between 0 and 1 that specifies the
        * amount of the width and height around the center to be used for the hotspot
        * of a cell and its default value is 0.5. In addition,
        * <mxConstants.MIN_HOTSPOT_SIZE> defines the minimum number of pixels for the
        * width and height of the hotspot.
        *
        * This solution, while standards compliant, may be somewhat confusing because
        * there is no visual indicator for the hotspot and the highlight is seen to
        * switch on and off while the mouse is being moved in and out. Furthermore,
        * this paradigm does not allow to create different connections depending on
        * the highlighted hotspot as there is only one hotspot per cell and it
        * normally does not allow cells to be moved and connected at the same time as
        * there is no clear indication of the connectable area of the cell.
        *
        * To come across these issues, the handle has an additional <createIcons> hook
        * with a default implementation that allows to create one icon to be used to
        * trigger new connections. If this icon is specified, then new connections can
        * only be created if the image is clicked while the cell is being highlighted.
        * The <createIcons> hook may be overridden to create more than one
        * <mxImageShape> for creating new connections, but the default implementation
        * supports one image and is used as follows:
        *
        * In order to display the "connect image" whenever the mouse is over the cell,
        * an DEFAULT_HOTSPOT of 1 should be used:
        *
        * (code)
        * mxConstants.DEFAULT_HOTSPOT = 1;
        * (end)
        *
        * In order to avoid confusion with the highlighting, the highlight color
        * should not be used with a connect image:
        *
        * (code)
        * mxConstants.HIGHLIGHT_COLOR = null;
        * (end)
        *
        * To install the image, the connectImage field of the mxConnectionHandler must
        * be assigned a new <mxImage> instance:
        *
        * (code)
        * mxConnectionHandler.prototype.connectImage = new mxImage('images/green-dot.gif', 14, 14);
        * (end)
        *
        * This will use the green-dot.gif with a width and height of 14 pixels as the
        * image to trigger new connections. In createIcons the icon field of the
        * handler will be set in order to remember the icon that has been clicked for
        * creating the new connection. This field will be available under selectedIcon
        * in the connect method, which may be overridden to take the icon that
        * triggered the new connection into account. This is useful if more than one
        * icon may be used to create a connection.
        *
        * Group: Events
        *
        * Event: mxEvent.START

        *
        * Note that the target is the cell under the mouse where the mouse button was released.

            * ncells - More than one cell selected.
            * notRoot - Drilling position is other than home.

            *

            * <mxEditor> instance, the <mxCell> instance under the mouse, and the
            * native mouse event.
            *
            * Custom Conditions:

            *   }
            * ]]></condition>
            * (end)
            *
            * The new condition can then be used in any item as follows:
            *
            * (code)
            * <add as="action1" action="action1" icon="action1.gif" if="condition1"/>

        *
        * Read/write Diagrams:
        *
        * To read a diagram from an XML string, for example from a textfield within the
        * page, the following code is used:
        *
        * (code)
        * var doc = mxUtils.parseXML(xmlString);
        * var node = doc.documentElement;
        * editor.readGraphModel(node);
        * (end)
        *
        * For reading a diagram from a remote location, use the <open> method.
        *
        * To save diagrams in XML on a server, you can set the <urlPost> variable.
        * This variable will be used in <getUrlPost> to construct a URL for the post
        * request that is issued in the <save> method. The post request contains the
        * XML representation of the diagram as returned by <writeGraphModel> in the
        * xml parameter.
        *
        * On the server side, the post request is processed using standard
        * technologies such as Java Servlets, CGI, .NET or ASP.
        *
        * Here are some examples of processing a post request in various languages.
        *
        * - Java: URLDecoder.decode(request.getParameter("xml"), "UTF-8").replace("\n", "&#xa;")
        *
        * Note that the linefeeds should only be replaced if the XML is
        * processed in Java, for example when creating an image, but not
        * if the XML is passed back to the client-side.
        *
        * - .NET: HttpUtility.UrlDecode(context.Request.Params["xml"])
        * - PHP: urldecode($_POST["xml"])
        *
        * Creating images:
        *
        * A backend (Java, PHP or C#) is required for creating images. The
        * distribution contains an example for each backend (ImageHandler.java,
        * ImageHandler.cs and graph.php). More information about using a backend
        * to create images can be found in the readme.html files. Note that the
        * preview is implemented using VML/SVG in the browser and does not require
        * a backend. The backend is only required to creates images (bitmaps).
        *
        * Special characters:
        *
        * Note There are five characters that should always appear in XML content as
        * escapes, so that they do not interact with the syntax of the markup. These
        * are part of the language for all documents based on XML and for HTML.
        *
        * - &lt; (<)
        * - &gt; (>)
        * - &amp; (&)
        * - &quot; (")
        * - &apos; (')
        *
        * Although it is part of the XML language, &apos; is not defined in HTML.
        * For this reason the XHTML specification recommends instead the use of
        * &#39; if text may be passed to a HTML user agent.
        *
        * If you are having problems with special characters on the server-side then
        * you may want to try the <escapePostData> flag.
        *
        * For converting decimal escape sequences inside strings, a user has provided
        * us with the following function:
        *
        * (code)
        * function html2js(text)
        * {
        *   var entitySearch = /&#[0-9]+;/;
        *   var entity;
        *
        *   while (entity = entitySearch.exec(text))
        *   {
        *     var charCode = entity[0].substring(2, entity[0].length -1);
        *     text = text.substring(0, entity.index)
        *            + String.fromCharCode(charCode)
        *            + text.substring(entity.index + entity[0].length);
        *   }
        *
        *   return text;
        * }
        * (end)
        *
        * Otherwise try using hex escape sequences and the built-in unescape function
        * for converting such strings.
        *
        * Local Files:
        *
        * For saving and opening local files, no standardized method exists that
        * works across all browsers. The recommended way of dealing with local files
        * is to create a backend that streams the XML data back to the browser (echo)
        * as an attachment so that a Save-dialog is displayed on the client-side and
        * the file can be saved to the local disk.
        *
        * For example, in PHP the code that does this looks as follows.
        *
        * (code)
        * $xml = stripslashes($_POST["xml"]);
        * header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"diagram.xml\"");
        * echo($xml);
        * (end)
        *
        * To open a local file, the file should be uploaded via a form in the browser
        * and then opened from the server in the editor.
        *
        * Cell Properties:
        *
        * The properties displayed in the properties dialog are the attributes and
        * values of the cell's user object, which is an XML node. The XML node is
        * defined in the templates section of the config file.
        *
        * The templates are stored in <mxEditor.templates> and contain cells which
        * are cloned at insertion time to create new vertices by use of drag and
        * drop from the toolbar. Each entry in the toolbar for adding a new vertex
        * must refer to an existing template.
        *
        * In the following example, the task node is a business object and only the
        * mxCell node and its mxGeometry child contain graph information:
        *
        * (code)
        * <Task label="Task" description="">
        *   <mxCell vertex="true">
        *     <mxGeometry as="geometry" width="72" height="32"/>
        *   </mxCell>
        * </Task>
        * (end)
        *
        * The idea is that the XML representation is inverse from the in-memory
        * representation: The outer XML node is the user object and the inner node is
        * the cell. This means the user object of the cell is the Task node with no
        * children for the above example:
        *
        * (code)
        * <Task label="Task" description=""/>
        * (end)
        *
        * The Task node can have any tag name, attributes and child nodes. The
        * <mxCodec> will use the XML hierarchy as the user object, while removing the
        * "known annotations", such as the mxCell node. At save-time the cell data
        * will be "merged" back into the user object. The user object is only modified
        * via the properties dialog during the lifecycle of the cell.
        *
        * In the default implementation of <createProperties>, the user object's
        * attributes are put into a form for editing. Attributes are changed using
        * the <mxCellAttributeChange> action in the model. The dialog can be replaced
        * by overriding the <createProperties> hook or by replacing the showProperties
        * action in <actions>. Alternatively, the entry in the config file's popupmenu
        * section can be modified to invoke a different action.
        *
        * If you want to displey the properties dialog on a doubleclick, you can set
        * <mxEditor.dblClickAction> to showProperties as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * editor.dblClickAction = 'showProperties';
        * (end)
        *
        * Popupmenu and Toolbar:
        *
        * The toolbar and popupmenu are typically configured using the respective
        * sections in the config file, that is, the popupmenu is defined as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * <mxEditor>
        *   <mxDefaultPopupMenu as="popupHandler">
        * 		<add as="cut" action="cut" icon="images/cut.gif"/>
        *      ...
        * (end)
        *
        * New entries can be added to the toolbar by inserting an add-node into the
        * above configuration. Existing entries may be removed and changed by
        * modifying or removing the respective entries in the configuration.
        * The configuration is read by the <mxDefaultPopupMenuCodec>, the format of the
        * configuration is explained in <mxDefaultPopupMenu.decode>.
        *
        * The toolbar is defined in the mxDefaultToolbar section. Items can be added
        * and removed in this section.
        *
        * (code)
        * <mxEditor>
        *   <mxDefaultToolbar>
        *     <add as="save" action="save" icon="images/save.gif"/>
        *     <add as="Swimlane" template="swimlane" icon="images/swimlane.gif"/>
        *     ...
        * (end)
        *
        * The format of the configuration is described in
        * <mxDefaultToolbarCodec.decode>.
        *
        * Ids:
        *
        * For the IDs, there is an implicit behaviour in <mxCodec>: It moves the Id
        * from the cell to the user object at encoding time and vice versa at decoding
        * time. For example, if the Task node from above has an id attribute, then
        * the <mxCell.id> of the corresponding cell will have this value. If there
        * is no Id collision in the model, then the cell may be retrieved using this
        * Id with the <mxGraphModel.getCell> function. If there is a collision, a new
        * Id will be created for the cell using <mxGraphModel.createId>. At encoding
        * time, this new Id will replace the value previously stored under the id
        * attribute in the Task node.
        *
        * See <mxEditorCodec>, <mxDefaultToolbarCodec> and <mxDefaultPopupMenuCodec>
        * for information about configuring the editor and user interface.
        *
        * Programmatically inserting cells:
        *
        * For inserting a new cell, say, by clicking a button in the document,
        * the following code can be used. This requires an reference to the editor.
        *
        * (code)
        * var userObject = new Object();
        * var parent = editor.graph.getDefaultParent();
        * var model = editor.graph.model;
        * model.beginUpdate();
        * try
        * {
        *   editor.graph.insertVertex(parent, null, userObject, 20, 20, 80, 30);
        * }
        * finally
        * {
        *   model.endUpdate();
        * }
        * (end)
        *
        * If a template cell from the config file should be inserted, then a clone
        * of the template can be created as follows. The clone is then inserted using
        * the add function instead of addVertex.
        *
        * (code)
        * var template = editor.templates['task'];
        * var clone = editor.graph.model.cloneCell(template);
        * (end)

    /**
        * XML codec for JavaScript object graphs. See <mxObjectCodec> for a
        * description of the general encoding/decoding scheme. This class uses the
        * codecs registered in <mxCodecRegistry> for encoding/decoding each object.
        *
        * References:
        *
        * In order to resolve references, especially forward references, the mxCodec
        * constructor must be given the document that contains the referenced
        * elements.
        *
        * Examples:
        *
        * The following code is used to encode a graph model.
        *
        * (code)
        * var encoder = new mxCodec();
        * var result = encoder.encode(graph.getModel());
        * var xml = mxUtils.getXml(result);
        * (end)
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * Using the code below, an XML document is decoded into an existing model. The
        * document may be obtained using one of the functions in mxUtils for loading
        * an XML file, eg. <mxUtils.get>, or using <mxUtils.parseXml> for parsing an
        * XML string.
        *
        * (code)
        * var doc = mxUtils.parseXml(xmlString);
        * var codec = new mxCodec(doc);
        * codec.decode(doc.documentElement, graph.getModel());
        * (end)
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * This example demonstrates parsing a list of isolated cells into an existing
        * graph model. Note that the cells do not have a parent reference so they can
        * be added anywhere in the cell hierarchy after parsing.
        *
        * (code)
        * var xml = '<root><mxCell id="2" value="Hello," vertex="1"><mxGeometry x="20" y="20" width="80" height="30" as="geometry"/></mxCell><mxCell id="3" value="World!" vertex="1"><mxGeometry x="200" y="150" width="80" height="30" as="geometry"/></mxCell><mxCell id="4" value="" edge="1" source="2" target="3"><mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry"/></mxCell></root>';
        * var doc = mxUtils.parseXml(xml);
        * var codec = new mxCodec(doc);
        * var elt = doc.documentElement.firstChild;
        * var cells = [];
        *
        * while (elt != null)
        * {
        *   cells.push(codec.decode(elt));
        *   elt = elt.nextSibling;
        * }
        *
        * graph.addCells(cells);
        * (end)
        *
        * Example:
        *
        * Using the following code, the selection cells of a graph are encoded and the
        * output is displayed in a dialog box.
        *
        * (code)
        * var enc = new mxCodec();
        * var cells = graph.getSelectionCells();
        * mxUtils.alert(mxUtils.getPrettyXml(enc.encode(cells)));
        * (end)
        *
        * Newlines in the XML can be converted to <br>, in which case a '<br>' argument
        * must be passed to <mxUtils.getXml> as the second argument.
        *
        * Debugging:
        *
        * For debugging I/O you can use the following code to get the sequence of
        * encoded objects:
        *
        * (code)
        * var oldEncode = mxCodec.prototype.encode;
        * mxCodec.prototype.encode = function(obj)
        * {
        *   mxLog.show();
        *   mxLog.debug('mxCodec.encode: obj='+mxUtils.getFunctionName(obj.constructor));
        *
        *   return oldEncode.apply(this, arguments);
        * };
        * (end)
        *
        * Note that the I/O system adds object codecs for new object automatically. For
        * decoding those objects, the constructor should be written as follows:
        *
        * (code)
        * var MyObj = function(name)
        * {
        *   // ...
        * };
        * (end)
        *
        * Constructor: mxCodec
        *
        * Constructs an XML encoder/decoder for the specified
        * owner document.
        *
        * Parameters:
        *
        * document - Optional XML document that contains the data.

        * Generic codec for JavaScript objects that implements a mapping between
        * JavaScript objects and XML nodes that maps each field or element to an
        * attribute or child node, and vice versa.
        *
        * Atomic Values:
        *
        * Consider the following example.
        *
        * (code)
        * var obj = new Object();
        * obj.foo = "Foo";
        * obj.bar = "Bar";
        * (end)
        *
        * This object is encoded into an XML node using the following.
        *
        * (code)
        * var enc = new mxCodec();
        * var node = enc.encode(obj);
        * (end)
        *
        * The output of the encoding may be viewed using <mxLog> as follows.
        *
        * (code)
        * mxLog.show();
        * mxLog.debug(mxUtils.getPrettyXml(node));
        * (end)
        *
        * Finally, the result of the encoding looks as follows.
        *
        * (code)
        * <Object foo="Foo" bar="Bar"/>
        * (end)
        *
        * In the above output, the foo and bar fields have been mapped to attributes
        * with the same names, and the name of the constructor was used for the
        * nodename.
        *
        * Booleans:
        *
        * Since booleans are numbers in JavaScript, all boolean values are encoded
        * into 1 for true and 0 for false. The decoder also accepts the string true
        * and false for boolean values.
        *
        * Objects:
        *
        * The above scheme is applied to all atomic fields, that is, to all non-object
        * fields of an object. For object fields, a child node is created with a
        * special attribute that contains the fieldname. This special attribute is
        * called "as" and hence, as is a reserved word that should not be used for a
        * fieldname.
        *
        * Consider the following example where foo is an object and bar is an atomic
        * property of foo.
        *
        * (code)
        * var obj = {foo: {bar: "Bar"}};
        * (end)
        *
        * This will be mapped to the following XML structure by mxObjectCodec.
        *
        * (code)
        * <Object>
        *   <Object bar="Bar" as="foo"/>
        * </Object>
        * (end)
        *
        * In the above output, the inner Object node contains the as-attribute that
        * specifies the fieldname in the enclosing object. That is, the field foo was
        * mapped to a child node with an as-attribute that has the value foo.
        *
        * Arrays:
        *
        * Arrays are special objects that are either associative, in which case each
        * key, value pair is treated like a field where the key is the fieldname, or
        * they are a sequence of atomic values and objects, which is mapped to a
        * sequence of child nodes. For object elements, the above scheme is applied
        * without the use of the special as-attribute for creating each child. For
        * atomic elements, a special add-node is created with the value stored in the
        * value-attribute.
        *
        * For example, the following array contains one atomic value and one object
        * with a field called bar. Furthermore it contains two associative entries
        * called bar with an atomic value, and foo with an object value.
        *
        * (code)
        * var obj = ["Bar", {bar: "Bar"}];
        * obj["bar"] = "Bar";
        * obj["foo"] = {bar: "Bar"};
        * (end)
        *
        * This array is represented by the following XML nodes.
        *
        * (code)
        * <Array bar="Bar">
        *   <add value="Bar"/>
        *   <Object bar="Bar"/>
        *   <Object bar="Bar" as="foo"/>
        * </Array>
        * (end)
        *
        * The Array node name is the name of the constructor. The additional
        * as-attribute in the last child contains the key of the associative entry,
        * whereas the second last child is part of the array sequence and does not
        * have an as-attribute.
        *
        * References:
        *
        * Objects may be represented as child nodes or attributes with ID values,
        * which are used to lookup the object in a table within <mxCodec>. The
        * <isReference> function is in charge of deciding if a specific field should
        * be encoded as a reference or not. Its default implementation returns true if
        * the fieldname is in <idrefs>, an array of strings that is used to configure
        * the <mxObjectCodec>.
        *
        * Using this approach, the mapping does not guarantee that the referenced
        * object itself exists in the document. The fields that are encoded as
        * references must be carefully chosen to make sure all referenced objects
        * exist in the document, or may be resolved by some other means if necessary.
        *
        * For example, in the case of the graph model all cells are stored in a tree
        * whose root is referenced by the model's root field. A tree is a structure
        * that is well suited for an XML representation, however, the additional edges
        * in the graph model have a reference to a source and target cell, which are
        * also contained in the tree. To handle this case, the source and target cell
        * of an edge are treated as references, whereas the children are treated as
        * objects. Since all cells are contained in the tree and no edge references a
        * source or target outside the tree, this setup makes sure all referenced
        * objects are contained in the document.
        *
        * In the case of a tree structure we must further avoid infinite recursion by
        * ignoring the parent reference of each child. This is done by returning true
        * in <isExcluded>, whose default implementation uses the array of excluded
        * fieldnames passed to the mxObjectCodec constructor.
        *
        * References are only used for cells in mxGraph. For defining other
        * referencable object types, the codec must be able to work out the ID of an
        * object. This is done by implementing <mxCodec.reference>. For decoding a
        * reference, the XML node with the respective id-attribute is fetched from the
        * document, decoded, and stored in a lookup table for later reference. For
        * looking up external objects, <mxCodec.lookup> may be implemented.
        *
        * Expressions:
        *
        * For decoding JavaScript expressions, the add-node may be used with a text
        * content that contains the JavaScript expression. For example, the following
        * creates a field called foo in the enclosing object and assigns it the value
        * of <mxConstants.ALIGN_LEFT>.
        *
        * (code)
        * <Object>
        *   <add as="foo">mxConstants.ALIGN_LEFT</add>
        * </Object>
        * (end)
        *
        * The resulting object has a field called foo with the value "left". Its XML
        * representation looks as follows.
        *
        * (code)
        * <Object foo="left"/>
        * (end)
        *
        * This means the expression is evaluated at decoding time and the result of
        * the evaluation is stored in the respective field. Valid expressions are all
        * JavaScript expressions, including function definitions, which are mapped to
        * functions on the resulting object.
        *
        * Expressions are only evaluated if <allowEval> is true.
        *
